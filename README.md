# CSS-Challenge

Live Demo https://hassanrazamuhammadtufail.github.io/Conquering-Responsive-Layout/


<strong>In this first week, we've looked at:</strong>
Using percentages for widths
Avoiding to set heights
Using max-width

While there is nothing overly complicated with any of that, being comfortable with these things is the key to mastering responsive layouts.

With a good understanding of the above, all we need is a little flexbox and we're going to start knocking even complex layouts out of the park!

In this section of the course, you can find a few links to some extra reading that you can do if you're looking to continue learning a bit. They'll help supplement what we're covering here, but none of it is required reading ðŸ˜Š.
